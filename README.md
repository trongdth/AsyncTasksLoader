# AsyncTasksLoader

This is a sample app which uses MVP architecture and retrofit2 for network calling.

- MVP: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-testing/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#0
- Retrofit2: http://square.github.io/retrofit/

Don't ask me why don't use AsyncTasksLoader. Basically, it's very hard to remember the way to implement it and I think you know what I mean :)
